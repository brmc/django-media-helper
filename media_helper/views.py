    First, the data received from the client is validated.  It should include
    two string representations of python lists of (str, int) tuples. The string
    being the original image name, the int being the new size of an image

    Then it rounds the size up to a value defined by the settings, and requests
    a new image.  If the image doesn't exist, the master copy of the image will
    be used  to generate a new copy.

    If the new image is larger than the master copy, the path to the master
    copy will be returned.

    If any thing else goes wrong, the placeholder image will be returned.

    Finally everything is packed into a json string and shipped back to the
    client.
