# Changelog

## v0.3.1-bugfix

* Fixed the long-description in setup.py that was causing installation to fail.
I'm still not quite sure why, so I just decided to hard-code it for now.

## v0.3

### New Features

* New management command to resize a specific image: --resize=PATH/FILENAME

* Images and backgrounds are now be preloaded before being replaced to avoid
flickering

* Created the following jQuery plugins for resizing and replacing images and
backgrounds to allow more granular control:
    swapImage(),
    swapBackground(),
    replaceAll()

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed unicode decode error in management.commands.mediahelper

* Changed resize quality from 85 to 'keep' because resized jpegs were often
  larger than their source files.
